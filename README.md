# PokeTool
Poketool side project for personal use. 

The Poketool is currently a program that is used to look up fairly basic information on Pokemon. As of now there is the ability to search every pokemon along with it's typing, and weaknesses for the most currently released game generation Pokemon Alpha Sapphire and Omega Ruby. The program is useful for quick operations to look up any Pokemon that may stand in your way. It was mostly intended for competitive use, but has it's uses for casual players as well. 

Plan to also make a visual system for breeding, along with a EV/IV calculator.

Future plan for this project is to incorporate a UI that does not use QTcreator and instead uses visual studios as the basis, so that a majority of windows machines will be able to use the program, and not just ones with QTCreator installed on them. There are also plans to start incorporating information about the PokemonTCG into the program as well.
